# Personal Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website template built with HTML and CSS and Javascript :).

Current Issues:
- minimize spacing between sections
- make contact its own section
- fix R Programming background
- Edit the skills so similar things are put together and delete some obvious skills
- Center navbar
- Update top header to reflect all these changes
- Make it pop?
